Youtube Data Analysis project was a comprehensive analysis of user behavior on Youtube, aimed at identifying patterns and trends that could help an organization run an effective ad campaign on the platform. The project was implemented using a variety of AWS tools, including S3, Glue, Lambda, and Athena, to automate the ETL process and generate valuable insights from the raw data.
The project began with the creation of an AWS account and the logging in to the AWS Management Console. An IAM user and group were created for the training, and a bucket was created in Amazon S3 using the North Virginia, US-East 1 region. The raw data was then uploaded to the bucket using AWS CLI. A crawler was created in AWS Glue named "de-on-youtubeanalysis-raw-glue-catalog-1" to crawl the data and create a table. A role was created under the crawler named "de-on-youtubeanalysis-glue-s3-role" to provide full access to Amazon S3.
The database "de_youtubeanalysis_raw" was created to store the output of the crawler. The table under this database was called "raw_statistics". Athena was used to run SQL queries on this table to get insights about the data. A separate bucket named "de-on-youtubeanalysis-raw-useast1-athena-job" was created to store the output of these queries. Since the queries failed on the json file due to the unstructured nature of the data, the json was converted to Apache Parquet using an AWS Lambda function named "de-on-youtubeanalysis-raw-east1-lambda-json-parquet".
The output of the lambda function was stored in a bucket named "de-on-youtubeanalysis-cleansed-useast1-dev". A crawler named "de-on-youtubeanalysis-crawler01" was created to crawl the csv file, and Athena was used to create a table for it under the same database "de_youtubeanalysis_raw". The datatype of the "id" field was changed using a job.
Finally, a job was created to store the entire data into a single bucket. A trigger was created for the source and destination. An AWS dashboard was created using AWS QuickSight to query the data generated by the ETL process.
In conclusion, the project was a success in automating the ETL process and generating valuable insights from the raw data. The use of AWS tools such as S3, Glue, Lambda, and Athena helped to streamline the process and make it more efficient. The insights generated from the data can help an organization run an effective ad campaign on Youtube, thus achieving its marketing goals. The AWS dashboard created using QuickSight provided an easy-to-use interface for querying the data and visualizing the results. Overall, the project demonstrated the power and potential of AWS tools for data analysis and provided valuable insights that can be leveraged by organizations to improve their marketing strategies.







Introduction
In today's digital age, businesses are increasingly relying on online advertising to reach their target audience. One of the most popular platforms for online advertising is YouTube, which is the second most visited website globally, after Google. As such, it is no surprise that an organization looking to run an online ad campaign has chosen YouTube as their advertising platform. However, to make the most out of their advertising budget, it is important for the organization to analyze YouTube's data to gain insights on user behavior, preferences, and engagement. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of YouTube's data to provide actionable insights for the organization's online ad campaign.

Problem Statement
Despite the popularity of YouTube as an advertising platform, many organizations struggle to optimize their ad campaigns due to a lack of understanding of user behavior and engagement on the platform. Without proper analysis, businesses can waste their advertising budget on ineffective campaigns that do not generate desired results. Therefore, there is a need to analyze YouTube's data to gain insights into user behavior, preferences, and engagement to optimize advertising campaigns effectively.

Solution
To address the problem of ineffective ad campaigns on YouTube, this project will conduct a comprehensive analysis of user behavior to identify patterns and trends. The analysis will focus on categorizing YouTube videos based on various categories such as entertainment, education, news, and more, and examining their engagement statistics and comments to identify what makes them popular. By understanding the content that resonates with users, the organization can optimize their ad campaign to align with user preferences and maximize engagement. The project will utilize various data analytics tools and techniques to uncover valuable insights that can be used to improve the effectiveness of the organization's online ad campaign on YouTube. Overall, this project will provide the organization with data-driven insights to make informed decisions and achieve their advertising objectives on YouTube.

Goals and Criteria
The goal of this project is to use AWS cloud infrastructure to collect and process YouTube data into a centralized data lake, which will be transformed using ETL design for analysis. The project is scalable, with a focus on adapting to future changes in data requirements to continuously analyze data for the organization's advertising campaign. The project aims to create comprehensive reports that provide actionable insights to optimize their advertising campaign and achieve advertising objectives on YouTube.
To measure success, the project's criteria include a high degree of accuracy and completeness during the data ingestion process. The AWS cloud infrastructure should be used effectively to provide a reliable and scalable solution that can handle large volumes of data and scale up or down as needed. The ETL design should be optimized for efficient processing and transformation of data, with minimal processing time and cost. Finally, the solution should provide customizable, clear, and concise reports that offer insights into user behavior and engagement on YouTube.
