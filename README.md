Introduction
In today's digital age, businesses are increasingly relying on online advertising to reach their target audience. One of the most popular platforms for online advertising is YouTube, which is the second most visited website globally, after Google. As such, it is no surprise that an organization looking to run an online ad campaign has chosen YouTube as their advertising platform. However, to make the most out of their advertising budget, it is important for the organization to analyze YouTube's data to gain insights on user behavior, preferences, and engagement. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of YouTube's data to provide actionable insights for the organization's online ad campaign.
